## Objective

Frontend developed as part of Challenge 03 in ModalGR's Training Program. Despite the program's main focus on backend development with NodeJS, we were required to create a system that addressed a real-world problem and integrated with the frontend.

I had limited frontend experience and had never used React before, making this my first full-stack project.

## Technologies Used

- React

## How It Was Done

I managed to create the screens in just under a week. During this time, I learned about components and was able to utilize some hooks like useState and useEffect.

## How to Access

The project is available and can be used and tested by anyone: [project link](https://diogoasenjo.github.io/desafio03-sistema-canoa-react/)
